# PSEUDO CODE FOR A PROGRAM THAT CREATES A RUNNING SUM

Step 1: Initialize a variable called 'sum' to 0
Step 2: Input a number and store it in a variable called 'num'
Step 3: Check if 'num' is negative
	a. If 'num' is negative, go to step 6
	b. If 'num' is positive, add 'num' to the variable 'sum'
Step 4: Input another number and store it in a variable 'num'
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a negative number is encountered
Step 6: Output the value of 'sum' as the running sum



# PSEUDO CODE FOR A PROGRAM THAT READS IN THREE NUMBERS AND WRITES THEM IN ASCENDING ORDER

Step 1: Input the first number and store it in a variable called 'num1'
Step 2: Input the second number and store it in a variable called 'num2'
Step 3: Input the third number and store it in a variable called 'num3'
Step 4: Create a list called 'numbers' and add 'num1', 'num2' and 'num3' to the list
Step 5: Sort the list 'numbers' in ascending order
Step 6: Output the sorted list 'numbers'


# PSEUDO CODE FOR A PROGRAM THAT CALCLUATES A SUM OF SQUARES OF GIVEN SET OF NUMBERS

Step 1: Input numbers into a list called 'numbers'
Step 2: Initialize a variable called 'sumOfSquares' to 0
Step 3: Loop through each number in the list 'numbers'
Step 4: For each number, calculate the square by multiplying the number by itself
Step 5: Add the result from step 4 to the variable 'sumOfSquares'
Step 6: Continue the loop until all numbers have been processed
Step 7: Output the value of 'sumOfSquares' as the sum of squares of the given input
